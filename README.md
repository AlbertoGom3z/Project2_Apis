Project 2 specs

APIs:

Must use at least one API.
API must be reasonably complex. OMDB API for example is not complex enough.
You may use an API we have used in class, but we will work with you to make the project more complex.
Must use your own API as well using mongo, node and express.
Must use HTML form elements.

Must include a README in the root directory of the project.

Discuss with us first if you want to use a library other than jQuery, including CSS libraries.

Must host your site on Heroku. We'll have a mini lesson later in the week on how to do this.

Because you have a while to do this project, we expect full functionality and nice CSS. As always, save CSS til the end.

Just like for project 1, instructors are not available for help on demand. You must submit a GH issue. See the instructions in this folder.

Planning: For this project you will spend a significant amount of time planning & researching your API before you ever start coding. Try to get a couple of APIs working. 98% of the time students choose their 2nd or 3rd choice of APIs because they couldn't get the 1st one working. Just move on, choose a different one, rework your project idea for the new API & get coding. Once you settle on an API, take time to sketch out how a user will use your website. Remember that UXD lesson.

One-on-ones: These are mandatory. Because this project is more open ended than the game project, we'll help you outline what an MVP of your project looks like.

Repos: Projects should be in new repos, not in the Robots repo.

Commits: You should commit & push every chance you get, but at a minimum twice a day.

Submitting: Projects are due Sunday at midnight.

Presentations: On Monday you will have 10 minutes to present to the class.

Some ideas for APIs:

First, Google around to find what other people thought of as easy-to-use APIs.
Choose an API that has good documentation, or at least a lot of stack overflow discussion so that you have some help as you try to get it working.
Here are some API's students used in our last class:

Google maps
Citibike
Etsy
Flickr
Last FM
Meetup
Guidebox

### design
  - first think of a MVP, what's the minimum required to show *something*.
  - think of your problems and identify them: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_elicitation#Problems
  - write your requirements down and use github to track your progress by creating some github issues for them: https://guides.github.com/features/issues/
